# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro - Using grid layouts, adding fonts to a webpage using @font-face, and media quieries, I have designed a responsive webpage so that it works well on cellular devices, tablets and desktop devices.
- Figma - Worked with designs on figma to create a webpage that works on mulitple different devices.
- Images - Worked with images and making them so that they work with the webpages and doesn't slow down the pages with large files.

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
